This repository hosts the open source seed dataset described in the paper [Small Data, Big Impact: Leveraging Minimal Data for Effective Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.154). The data, which is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), is currently being managed by OLDI, the [Open Language Data Initiative](https://oldi.org).

## Data

The parallel corpus currently contains 6,193 sentences sampled from English Wikipedia and translated into 39 languages. It can be used to kick-start machine translation models for language directions which currently lack large-scale datasets.
