## Additional language information

The data is in standard Italian, as spoken in the Republic of Italy. Further information on the history of the language is available in V. Coletti, _Storia dell'italiano letterario_, Einaudi, 2022. Spellcheckers for this language are available natively on all major word processing software packages and via [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io).

## Workflow

An initial version of this data, machine translated from English and partially post-edited, was released by Hablerland et al. (see Attribution section). The data was subsequently reviewed in its entirety by two native speakers of Italian and further post-edited to ensure high quality. Please refer to the paper for further information.
